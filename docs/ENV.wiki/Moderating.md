# ⛨ Duties of a Discord community moderator

🙏 Please do your best and use your common sense. We can ask no more. Your support is gratefully received.

A list is no substitute for common sense. But here are some suggestions:

- Summon order from the chaos

- Help keep conversation on-topic (direct convos to the appropriate channels)

- Help users with issues as you are able, drop a message in #team-chat to get contrib/catalyst/maintainer eyes on it

- Help keep the peace

- Draw attention of core-devs to where it's needed
    Core-devs often do not follow the conversation in the main user channels

Your work is valued and appreciated! 🙏 ❤️ ✨
