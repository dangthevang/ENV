# 4 May 2023 ALERT: HyperDrive Engaged! ðŸš€

We are (as of yesterday) RE-ARCHITECTING the core of AutoGPT

This requires tight coordination.

If you're interested to track progress (or involve) check out #re-arch channel on our Discord.

If you're contributing to this project (e.g. have PRs stuck in the pipeline):
- We're sorry to create suffering (but think this is for the Greater Good)
- You're likely aware that the core is a mess and NEEDS re-architecting
- So we hope you understand that this needs to be done
- Please be patient and work with us on this
- We're doing our best

### NOTE FOR PLUGIN DEVS:

If you already have an existing plug-in thatâ€™s affected, please message @ntindle on Discord so we can get your plugin spinning on the new architecture.

If you're working on a plugin, please bear in mind that one of our primary goals in re-architecting is to make life MUCH easier for you. We've taken aboard feedback from plugin developers. We're on it, so please give us some time!


- If you're enthusiastic to participate but it's all rather bewildering:
    - Please connect with other devs in the Discord channels, and engage
    - Please be patient as we get the new core into shape and exit hyperdrive


How to move forwards? How to involve?

### 0. If your PR is no longer relevant, best to close it


### 1. wait for the dust to settle

- This may require further work (later) on your part to amend your PR into the new arch
- However, this will enable us to focus on the re-arch


### 2. push for your PR to be merged into master before re-integration

- Once we've got a solid chassis, we'll be moving code across from the old structure to the new
- It may make sense logistically to merge your PR before this
- However, it takes attention of core-devs from the re-arch
- Please try to arrive at the same decision you would if you were co-ordinating the project
- You're invited to discuss in the Discord


### 3. Engaging in the re-arch

- During this re-architecture phase we need senior devs.  

- A lot of planning has already been done.  Read through the #re-arch channel first. NOTE: click the ðŸ“Œ -- the first pinned message switchboards to info-resources!

- If you know what you're doing and feel the urge to accelerate our progress / improve our process:
    - _Please_ DM pi#8377 (you'll need to join the Discord first) and ask for a Contributor badge
        - say who you are (link your github etc.)
        - say what you're doing / would like to do
        - if you've got a PR in the pipeline, link it
