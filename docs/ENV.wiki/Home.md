# 👁️ Vision 

```
    We tend to define ourselves by what we DO.
    And this is crazy if you think about it.
    What if AI is able to do FOR us.
    How do we then define ourselves?
    By what we CREATE!

We build AutoGPT to better the world.  
The industrial revolution changed the manner in which we live.  
Now the AI revolution is upon us.  

With great power comes great responsibility.  
Be aware of your intentions, and help us build a brighter tomorrow! ☀️
