# Project Management

## Issues

If you create an issue, fill the template out. 

## Reviews

We do code reviews for all changes. 

### Process Overview

1. Discuss an issue
1. Propose a fix to the team (unless you are the maintainer of that region of code)
1. Open a PR
1. Be respectful of your reviewers and fix the things discussed
1. As a reviewer, if you have a small or minor nitpick, use `nit:` before your comment. These issues aren't worthy of blocking the PR but they bother the hell out of you.
1. As an author, if you don't fix a nit, convert it to an issue and put it in the backlog and label it `help wanted`.

### General Rules

1. Only make one conceptual change per PR. I don't care if you're internal, external, or Toran himself. You must follow this.
1. Your tests must pass to merge.
1. You must retain backward compatibility for user-facing changes or have an announcement announcing the changes in advance.
1. You must give and get real reviews. 
1. You must not reduce the coverage by more than 5% overall.

### The Pull Request Body

Externally, we enforce a strict requirement of filling out the PR details. 
Internally, I'd appreciate it if you did. 

# Communication

This governs our expectations around communication, processes, and more

## Expectations 

You are expected to work with the team in a healthy and collaborative way.
You may be asked to join meetings, be flexible. We are as globally distributed as possible.
You are expected to communicate your working areas when you start working on them, not just before you open the PR.
